#   Usage Message FUNCTION
#
#   ************************************************************
#   ***Warning*** This comment would be long, it's for reference:
#   *************************************************************
#   The Usage function I created here is a bit tricky, this is what happens,
#   I take $1 which is supposed to represent the script name, and it then stores it in a little variable called script. 
#
#   Shouldn't $1 be a first positional argument, it shouldn't be a script name right? That is correct, but consider we call the 
#   usage function as so:
#
#   usage $0 websitename 
#
#   The usage word above isn't a parameter, it is a function, and it takes the $0 (script name) as its first positional argument 
#   ($1), and it then stores it in the variable script in the usage function. 
#    
#    The shift in the function skips the first parameter, this way we can separate the script name from the rest of the   
#     paramater, so, whatever other parameter you pass e.g if you
#    pass $2 it would now represent $1, and if you pass $3, it would now represent $2 and so on. $* in the function makes us
#     perform test on all the other arguments, even if you supply 20.

#   "basename" is used to transform "/home/devsrealm/install_classicpress"
#   into "install_classicpress"
usage()
{
    script=$1
    shift
    echo

#
#   This Prompt the user to exit the program, if they choose to,

#

    #   overwrites $1.
    #

#   sFTP is a â€œsecure version of file transfer protocol which helps

  #
  #   The goal of this function is not to create an sftp access arbitrarily, but to
  #   to jail a user, this way they have no way to break out of their home directory.
  #
  #   We then mount a location to their home directory, so they can upload files to their website root folder.
  #   For example, If user "paul" needs to upload files to /var/www/websitename.com, we chroot to /home/jail/paul
  #   and then mount /var/www/websitename.com to their home directory, this way, they can upload to the correct website directory without 
  #   needing access to it, and thus, things would be breeze and secure.

#   phpMyAdmin is a free software tool written in PHP, intended to handle the administration of MySQL over the Web.

#   can be performed via the user interface, while you still have the ability to 
#   directly execute any SQL statement.
#
#   This function would automate the installation of phpMyAdmin, phpmyadmin would also configure the database for us, so, you don't
