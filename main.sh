#   Usage Message FUNCTION
#
#   ************************************************************
#   ***Warning*** This comment would be long, it's for reference:
#   *************************************************************
#   The Usage function I created here is a bit tricky, this is what happens,
#   I take $1 which is supposed to represent the script name, and it then stores it in a little variable called script. 
#
#   Shouldn't $1 be a first positional argument, it shouldn't be a script name right? That is correct, but consider we call the 
#   usage function as so:
#
#   usage $0 websitename 
#
#   The usage word above isn't a parameter, it is a function, and it takes the $0 (script name) as its first positional argument 
#   ($1), and it then stores it in the variable script in the usage function. 
#    
#    The shift in the function skips the first parameter, this way we can separate the script name from the rest of the   
#     paramater, so, whatever other parameter you pass e.g if you
#    pass $2 it would now represent $1, and if you pass $3, it would now represent $2 and so on. $* in the function makes us
#     perform test on all the other arguments, even if you supply 20.

#   "basename" is used to transform "/home/devsrealm/install_classicpress"
#   into "install_classicpress"
