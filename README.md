# Automate Multiple Classic and WordPress Sites
If you are tired of using control panels (I am because they are mostly not secure), and want to do everything on the server level, I wrote a menu-driven bash program that handles the installation of ClassicPress or WordPress using Nginx (+ Caching), PHP and mariadb.

It also provides the ability to secure your website using Let's Encrypt, and Certbot for the auto-config. I made this optional because am I just want to do some local development, so, there is no need for SSL.
